# Stream-chunk-promise [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/noblesamurai/stream-chunk-promise.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/noblesamurai/stream-chunk-promise) [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/stream-chunk-promise.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/stream-chunk-promise)

> Get a promise that resolves when we can read(size) next chunk of stream.

## Usage

```js
// Several examples of usage.
// Usually copying and pasting code from the tests and making the code standalone suffices.
const nextChunk = require('stream-chunk-promise');
const stream = someReadableStream();
const size = 10;
const assert = require('assert');
nextChunk(stream, size).then((result) => {
  assert(result.length === size);
});
```
